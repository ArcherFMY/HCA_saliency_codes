% REGIONADJACENCY Computes adjacency matrix for image of labeled segmented regions
%
% Usage:  [Am, Al] = regionadjacency(L, connectivity)
%
% Arguments:  L - A region segmented image, such as might be produced by a
%                 graph cut or superpixel algorithm.  All pixels in each
%                 region are labeled by an integer.
%  connectivity - 8 or 4.  If not specified connectivity defaults to 8.
%
% Returns:   Am - An adjacency matrix indicating which labeled regions are
%                 adjacent to each other, that is, they share boundaries. Am
%                 is sparse to save memory.
%            Al - A cell array representing the adjacency list corresponding
%                 to Am.  Al{n} is an array of the region indices adjacent to
%                 region n.
%
% Regions with a label of 0 are not processed. They are considered to be
% 'background regions' that are not to be considered.  If you want to include
% these regions you should assign a new positive label to these areas using, say
% >> L(L==0) = max(L(:)) + 1;

    % Strategy:  Step through the labeled image.  For 8-connectedness inspect 
    % pixels as follows and set the appropriate entries in the adjacency
    % matrix.

    % Becuase the adjacency search looks 'forwards' a final OR operation is
    % performed on the adjacency matrix and its transpose to ensure
    % connectivity both ways.
